<p>Welcome to my site of software DSP. This website is dedicated to sharing both <b>theoretical and practical work</b> I produce in <b>software DSP</b> (that is, digital signal processing, e.g. audio and image, done in software). There's also a blog that I use for exploring some contemporary topics that I find interesting, particularly in the context of audio DSP, e.g. procedural sound generation, or some projects that I'm involved in.</p>

<p>My long term interests are related to <b>procedural sound generation</b> and broadly <b>"physically modelled audio"</b> as its a topic that hasn't been explored too much and which can be mathematically (as well as aesthetically) rather involved. The benefits are however fairly reasonable since sample-based sound can be limited in the sense of interactivity and missing realism that's achievable only using computational, rather than artistic methods. <!-- As it has been demonstrated e.g. by these two projects: --></p>

<p>I'm also interested in novel and esoteric, unbeforeheard/-seen signal processing algorithms such as those <b>blending the boundary of image and audio signal processing algorithms</b>, as demonstrated in the popular program Metasynth, as well as synthetic methods that display a high level of realism. Additionally I like software over hardware in the sense that my other "knack" is for replacing hardware with software, that is, I'm somewhat interested in (as it relates to e.g. physically modelled audio) the possibilities of analog modelling and in many ways replicating the real world in software, since this has some advantages (no manufacturing, unlimited copying, wide customability etc.).</p>

<p> I have no fixed set of tools that I work with, but I have found that the ones that are either commonly used for these kinds of programs are <b>C++</b> (for plug-in work I like the <b>WDL-OL</b> framework) and at the higher level one may use <b>Python</b> (<b>Scipy</b>). For audio signal processing I've found <b>CSound</b> to be a particularly interesting API, since it runs on PC, is written in C++ and has a large existing library of sound processing code with some fairly esoteric algorithms as well. I'm also finding <b>Pure Data</b> useful. The code you will find on this site will be mainly using these. I prefer to work and support non-commercial and open source efforts.</p>

<p> From the <b>Commercial</b> and <b>Open Source</b> sections you can find <b>signal processing software</b> that I have developed and wish to distribute. The commercial software is either propietarily licensed (source not available) or available for a fee (e.g. a software library). The open source software is hosted in <b>Github</b> and is free access with licenses varying on a project basis.
