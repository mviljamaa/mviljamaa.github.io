<p>The 15th tutorial has been published. It is a video tutorial which explains how to bake lightmaps in Blender, even if the concept is the same with other modelers.<br />
It also features an basic introduction to Blender manipulation &amp; modeling.</p>
<p>The Download page and the Google Code project have been updated accordingly; The source code also reflects many of the feedback I received.</p>
