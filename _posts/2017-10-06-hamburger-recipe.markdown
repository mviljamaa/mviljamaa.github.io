So, hamburgers are one of my favorite foods, mainly because they're easy to make and taste good. 
If one makes them at home, then they are also fairly healthy. I have been interested in 
emulating particularly Burger King burgers for some time, so I've worked towards that direction.

What you need to do:

-Generic hamburger buns, toasted in the toaster.
-Low-fat ground beef (has to be 100% beef) patties cooked in the oven, not in the pan.
-Iceberg Lettuce (has to be this variety).
-Tomato slices, should be "right" thickness.
-Pickled Cucumber sliced. This is important for the overall hamburger taste.
-Generic mayonnaise-based hamburger sauce. Or one can improvise one's own sauce.
-Cheddar-flavour processed cheese. The usual cheese used in commercial hamburgers.

Optionally:

-Flame grill the patties or use a combination of flame grilling and oven. This will result into Burger King likeness.

One can see that the recipe has no special ingredients, all the usual ingredients as in commercial hamburgers.
However, I've done some testing and figured out that doing the patties in the oven is much better than doing
them in the pan. Additonally they can be flame grilled for Burger King -like taste. It's also important to
toast the buns in the toaster before constructing the burger.

So this is a generic recipe, but some "to the point" improvements.
