I've found the need to define chains for drums processing, because although one can discover channel strip like plug-ins meant for drum sounds, I've found most of them a bit rudimentary. Very often the strip offers some EQ, some compressor and perhaps a transient designer section. However, I've learned that there are more processes that suit drums, than what "drum chains" generally contain. Thus I decided to break down some of my ideas regarding drum processing.
