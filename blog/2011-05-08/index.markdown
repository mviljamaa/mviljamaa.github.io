This is a more hobby post, but I happened to acquire a HP DL 585 server lately. It has pretty nice features for the price,
but the noise it makes with the default Nidec Beta V VA450DC fans is like a vacuum cleaner.

In order to be able to utilize the serve in my room, I decided to see if the fans could be switched to more silent ones. As I couldn't find 120mm x 38mm
fans that have reasonable noise levels (even if they have a high CFM value), I decided to use conventional 120mm x 20mm fans.

Knowing that Nanoxia Deep Silence 120mm has a pretty good noise/CFM -ratio, I decided to try these in the DL585. Someone else might want to try Noctuas or what not, it doesn't
really change how the fans are put there.

The problem with the DL 585 hot-swappable fan cages is that they're modeled for 120mm x 38mm fans. There are few things in the cage that make it impossible to fit a 120mm x 20mm fan to it. It's a bit stupid design maybe, because
it could have been made to accomodate fans of both sizes.

In order to fit a 120mm x 20mm fan in the cage, I figured that I had to remove all the plastic parts. And leave only the metal cage as well as the wiring.
Practically this is not too bad, because eventhough one cannot utilize the fans in as hot-swappable fashion as the original ones, one can still fit new fans in place of the default ones in a practical, usable way.
